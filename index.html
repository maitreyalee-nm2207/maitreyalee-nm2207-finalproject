            Ah, the ever infamous string of numbers that most Singaporeans shun away from. </strong><br></p>
        
        <p class="introText">Section 377A reads:</p>
        
            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_377A_(Singapore)#cite_note-14" id="introQuote">"Any male person who, in public or private, commits, 
            or abets the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency with another male person, 
            shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years." <br>
            — <em>Outrages on decency</em>, Section 377A, Singapore Penal Code
        
        </blockquote>
        
        <p class="introText">
            This law criminalises sex between males, regardless of whether the act was performed in private or not. It has always been a contentious issue between the LGBTQ+ community, 
            who claimed the clause was discriminatory, and their opponents, who supported the retention of Section 377A due to reasons such as religious faith.
            The LGBTQ+ community faces discrimination and stigmatisation on the daily, from obtaining basic necessities such as housing and being subjected to “conversion therapy”. 
            There is a severe breach of basic human rights, where certain individuals within our community experience unfair treatment and harsh judgements simply based on their sexual orientation or what gender they identify with.</p>
        <p class="introText">
            Last debated in Parliament back in 2007, Singapore has always taken a neutral stance at best regarding the LGBTQ+ community and Section 377A. 
            However, the announcement of the repeal of Section 377A on 21 August 2022</a> by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during the annual National Day Rally 
            marked a deliberate step towards greater acceptance. Section 377A was officially repealed on 3 January 2023, marking a momentous day for the LGBTQ+ community.

        <p class="introText">Yet, the one-million dollar question markedly remains:</p>

            Woah, that's quite a sharp increase in the number of Baby Boomers aged 65 and above in Singapore.
            Of course, this should come as no surprise, as Singapore is facing an ageing population.

        <p>Well, it seems like the consensus is quite split when different age groups are analysed. 
            The younger generation tend to show greater support for the community and oppose of Section 377A, 
            while the older generation who tend to hold more conservative and traditional views are more likely to support Section 377A and are less accepting of the community.</p>
        <p>Granted, the data presented here is from 2018, but given that these deeply-rooted perceptions take a long time to shift, 
            it would be safe to assume that the older generation is generally less accepting of the LGBTQ+ community than the younger generation.

<!-- conclusion -->
<div id="conclusion" onmouseover="typeWriter()">
    <p id="conclusionHeader"></p>
    <p class="conclusionText">While the repeal of Section 377A is a step in the right direction, the stigmatisation and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ society is still rather prominent in our society today. 
        Many cite religious beliefs and societal norms as reasons as to why they are not accepting of the LGBTQ+ society, and would definitely be challenging to expect immediate changes in perceptions right after the repeal of Section 377A.
    </p>
    <p class="conclusionText">However, views on the community are changing, slowly but surely, and more conversations on this “taboo” topic are starting to surface. 
        As the nation's next generation of leaders and trailblazers, let's aspire to shift perceptions and create a society with greater acceptance!
